### Project Description

The website will utilize the device's GPS capabilities to determine the user's current location and then display a straight line to a specified destination on a map. This approach simplifies navigation by eliminating the need for turn-by-turn directions.

other Features:

Menu bar:  Run, Pause, Restart, Speed Controller
A car moves along the straight line
There is a useless compass, useless zoom in and out

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

Find the shortest distance from one place to another

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

The shortest distance is displacement, that is a straight line.
