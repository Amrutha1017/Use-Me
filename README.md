### Project Description
[The website will utilize the device's GPS capabilities to determine the user's current location and then display a straight line to a specified destination on a map. This approach simplifies navigation by eliminating the need for turn-by-turn directions.
other Features:
Menu bar: Run, Pause, Restart, Speed Controller
A car moves along the straight line
There is a useless compass, useless zoom in and out]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Find the shortest distance from one place to another

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
The shortest distance is displacement, that is a straight line.
